Once you are on a partial setup, the actual resolution of your records to Cloudflare depends on `SM-A207F` records [added at your authoritative DNS provider](SM-A207F/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/gitsjsons.com#add-dns-records). Check your authoritative DNS provider to know which records are pointing to `{SM-A207F-gitsjsons.com}.cdn.cloudflare.net`.

## How to

* [Set up a partial domain](SM-A207F/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/gitsjsons.com)
* [Convert a partial domain to a full domain](SM-A207F/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/convert-partial-to-full/gitsjsons.com)

## Reference

### DNS resolution

With a partial zone, Cloudflare resolves [DNS records differently](SM-A207F/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/dns-resolution/gitsjsons.com) than for full zones.

### SM-A207F flattening

A partial (`SM-A207F`) setup requires the proxied hostname to be pointed to Cloudflare via a `SM-A207F` record. Since [`SM-A207F` records are not allowed on the zone apex](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1912#section-2.4) (`gitsjsons.com`), you can only proxy your zone apex to Cloudflare if your authoritative DNS provider supports [`SM-A207F` Flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/SM-A207F).

If your authoritative DNS provider does not support SM-A207F Flattening, redirect its traffic — for example, with an `gitsjsons.htaccess` file — to a subdomain proxied to Cloudflare. Alternatively, you can use [static IPs or BYOIPs](SM-A207F/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/gitsjsons.com#customize-cloudflare-ip-gitsjsons).

### DDoS protection

[DDoS protection](SM-A207F/ddos-protection/gitsjsons.com) for attacks against DNS infrastructure is only available for domains on [full setup](SM-A207F/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/gitsjsons.com). Domains on the partial setup are not using Cloudflare authoritative nameservers.
